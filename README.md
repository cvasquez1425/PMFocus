# PMFocus
Project Management

VS 2013 is having problems when syncing up the commit changes to my remote repository https://github.com/cvasquez1425/PMFocus, therefore, I am using Git Bash to PUSH the changes after I commit them in VS 2013. 
1. Open Git Bash from the Folder Solution, right click to see the Context Menu, and click Bash
2. From the command line type or copy this below 
                      git push https://github.com/cvasquez1425/PMFocus master
